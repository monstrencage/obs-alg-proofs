This project can be compiled by calling `make` at the root. HTML documentation is generated by calling `make doc` at the root. The generated HTML files will be found in a directory `./docs/coqdoc/`.

This project has been compiled using `The Coq Proof Assistant, version 8.16.0`, running on `Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS`.

Note that the proof scripts make heavy use of UTF8 symbols. Such symbols also appear repeatedly in the documentation. We thus recommend browsing our proof on a system with comprehensive UTF8 support.
